# 📦 Mike’s Dev Setup Installer

An automated Windows setup script using Chocolatey and Winget to quickly install my essential development tools, IDEs, and utilities.
Runs in silent mode (auto-accepts licenses).

## Run
Installer can easily be run by executing this command in the folder of the downloaded script in a admin Powershell console.
